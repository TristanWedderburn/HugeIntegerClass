# HugeIntegerClass
 The range of integers that can be represented in Java using a primitive data type is only from 2^63 to 2^63-1.  What if we need to manipulate integer values beyond this range? The HugeInteger class is able to represent arbitrarily large integer numbers and implement arithmetic operations on them.
